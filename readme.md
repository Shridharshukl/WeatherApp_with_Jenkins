## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates how to automate a software delivery workflow using Jenkins. The weather app fetches real-time weather data and is built, tested, scanned, packaged, and deployed automatically through Jenkins using a robust pipeline.

## ✨ Features

* 🌤️ Weather search by city
* 📦 Docker-based deployment
* 🔍 Static code analysis with SonarQube
* 🔐 Container image scanning with Trivy
* 🛠️ CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins
* 🔄 Auto-updating Kubernetes YAML via GitOps

## 🔧 Jenkins Pipeline

The Jenkins pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`) includes the following stages:

1. **Checkout**: Clone code from GitHub.
2. **SonarQube Scan**: Run static code analysis.
3. **Docker Build & Trivy Scan**:

   * Build Docker image.
   * Scan image for vulnerabilities using Trivy.
   * Push image to DockerHub.
4. **Update YAML & Git Push**:

   * Update deployment YAML with the new image tag.
   * Commit and push changes back to GitHub.
5. **Complete**: Print pipeline completion status.

> 🔐 Secrets like GitHub token and DockerHub credentials are managed via Jenkins Credentials.

## 📦 CI/CD Flow

Here’s what happens when Jenkins runs:

1. Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub.
2. Runs SonarQube scanner to check code quality.
3. Builds Docker image and scans it with Trivy.
4. Pushes the image to DockerHub.
5. Updates the deployment YAML with the new tag.
6. Pushes changes back to GitHub (for ArgoCD/Kubernetes to deploy).
